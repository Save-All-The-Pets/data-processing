## Environment setup

* Create a `.exports` file that you source into a `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file.  This will allow securely managing all project related secrets locally as well as support reproducibility.
* Install docker - see here for instructions [docker setup](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
